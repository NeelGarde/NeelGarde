<font size= "6">Project Summary

<font size= "6">This is the datasheet for Neel Garde's subsystem of Team 210's water quality monitoring device - see [team report.](https://egr304-2025-f-210.github.io/)


My Contribution

* My contribution to the team project is the controller/user interface subsystem.
* This subsystem serves as a motherboard to connect and control the other three sensor subsystems to make a functional water quality monitoring device
* To review the system's schematic, you can review it in the ["schematic"](https://neelgarde.github.io/NeelGarde/04-Schematic/schematic/) section of the datasheet
* To review ta block diagram of the system, you can review it in the ["block diagram"](https://neelgarde.github.io/NeelGarde/01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/) section of the datasheet
* To review the details listed of the material used to construct the subsection, you can review it in the ["BOM"](https://neelgarde.github.io/NeelGarde/03-BOM/BOM/) section of the datasheet.
