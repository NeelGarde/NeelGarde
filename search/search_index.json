Since there is no OS on the PIC, only one hardware timer is available. Since scheduling method is unknown, all program must be run as a single thread, or the debouncing may not be accurate May not function at startup of PIC <p>Decision: A custom debouncing circuit will be chosen due to the complexity of porting an OS (such as FreeRTOS) to the PIC to share timer resources and the option to have the user use buttons on the PIC\u2019s startup to enter debugging modes.</p> <p>Level Shifters</p> Image Product Price Pros Cons V62/24621-01XE $3.48 Provides 6 circuits,simplifying board Simple pin layout Fast switching Will not arrive in time, out of stock SMD CD40109BPWR $0.46 Does not require high voltage supply Only has 4 circuits, so 2 units will be required SMD 74AXP2T45DCH $0.77 Compact THT Unidirectional Only has 4 circuits, so 2 units will be required <p>Decision: The 74AXP2T45DCH will be selected due to it\u2019s ease of soldering and compactness.

If the MCU is not especially sensitive, 10k is a generally accepted standard for 5V microcontrollers. Debouncing low-pass filter (RC) Using the relationship debouncetime \\= 5RC, and an arbitrary debounce of 10 ms (assumed to be a reasonable time for a human to make a confident input without becoming annoying), and a capacitor value of 0.1 uF to keep physical size down, I calculated a 20kOhm resistor would be suitable. LCD header pin assignments Pins allocated by datasheet. A level shifter is used to translate the 5V logic from the PIC to the 3.3V logic required by the LCD controller daughterboard. Speaker design Design from in-class lab updated with datasheet for specific speaker used. A voltage divider was added to better suit the speaker's frequency-voltage chart. Power supplies Basic design from datasheets. A second 5V input with a diode and fuse was added to the 3.3V regulator to allow functioning when being powered by another subsystem. The diodes and fuse are to prevent the 9V supply from being connected to the 5V rail."},{"location":"04-Schematic/schematic/#resouces","title":"Resouces","text":"<p>The schematic as a PDF download is available here, and the Zip folder of the project here.</p>"},{"location":"05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/","title":"Power Budget","text":""},{"location":"05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>As this subsystem involves multiple active components and an actuator, a power budget was required to ensure that the two main rails and regulators would be sufficient, and that our plan of sharing a 5V rail from the pH sensor subsystem would be feasible.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/#conclusions","title":"Conclusions","text":"<p>The power draw of the controller subsystem is minimal when the speaker is off, and both wall-power and power-sharing with teammates should be no issue.
