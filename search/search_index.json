As the primary function of this device is bluetooth communication, and the PIC family does not include any units with built-in wireless functionality, the ESP32 will be chosen. Additional benefits of the ESP32 include a more reliable development environment by leveraging open-source tools such as mpremote, Visual Studio Code and Python/MicroPython.\n\nThe pinout of the ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N4 module is as follows:\n![](pinout.png)\n\nSubsystem A3's role on the team is to provide a BLE GATT server onboard the robot, and route data between the daisy-chain bus and the BLE communication to the controller unit (systems A1 and A2). To do this, A3 must be capable of recieving unregulated power from the robot's onboard daisy-chain bus and regulate it to it's required 3.3V. No additional sensors, actuators or displays will be used. Simple debug buttons and LEDs will be used to assist with testing.\n\nTo perform the necessary bluetooth functions, the aioble library will be used. This library provides a wrapper over MicroPython's bluetooth API, making development simpler and more reliable. This library allows modules for client and server to be loaded individually, reducing the program size.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"03-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#power-budget","title":"Power Budget","text":"<pre><code>This section is WIP.
