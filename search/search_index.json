Since scheduling method is unknown, all program must be run as a single thread, or the debouncing may not be accurate May not function at startup of PIC <p>Decision: A custom debouncing circuit will be chosen due to the complexity of porting an OS (such as FreeRTOS) to the PIC to share timer resources and the option to have the user use buttons on the PIC\u2019s startup to enter debugging modes.</p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>written context</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#bill-of-materials-example-as-table","title":"Bill of Materials Example (as Table)","text":"<p>Table ##: An example of one approach to adding your BOM table to this section.</p> Part Name/Description Qty Unit Cost Total Cost Manufacture Manufacturer # Vendor Link Datasheet Link Schematic Reference Designators 8-bit SIPO/SISO Shift Register, SOIC-16 package 1 $0.49 $ 0.49 NXP 74HC595D,112 DigiKey datasheet link U1 0.1 \u00b5F Ceramic Capacitor, +/-10%, X7R, 50V, 0805 package 10 0.2750 $2.75 KEMET C0805F104K5RACTU PRLTA 109 n/a C2, C4, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C16 <p>Note: Setting it up as a table is nice because it is completely viewable without scaling issues.
